I am an emerging software engineer building web systems end-to-end to understand how software behaves in real conditions.  
I focus on solving tangible problems, making design decisions under constraints, and iterating with intention.

## 🛠️ Applied Skills

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, DOM manipulation  
- **Backend (learning):** Node.js, REST APIs  
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub workflow with commit discipline  
- **System Design & Problem Solving:** decomposing problems, balancing constraints, and reflecting on trade-offs

Demonstrating Skills through projects I structure as systems, beyond tutorials.

## 🔹 Projects

### 1. Calculator System
- **Problem:** Build a calculator handling all basic arithmetic reliably  
- **Constraints:** Correctly handle edge cases, maintain separation of logic for calculations and display  
- **Decisions:** Modularized JS functions; event-driven interaction; error handling for invalid inputs  
- **Outcome:** Learned how to manage state cleanly and enforce predictable behavior in interactive applications

### 2. Browser-Based Game
- **Problem:** Implement a Rock-Paper-Scissors game with randomized computer opponent  
- **Constraints:** Responsive UI, accurate game logic, user input validation  
- **Decisions:** Event delegation, DOM updates optimized for clarity, modular code for maintainability  
- **Outcome:** Practiced handling asynchronous interactions and iterative feedback loops

### 3. Interactive Grid Drawing System
- **Problem:** Create a dynamic grid allowing drawing and resizing  
- **Constraints:** Performance optimization, dynamic DOM handling, reset functionality  
- **Decisions:** Dynamic grid creation, event delegation for efficient performance  
- **Outcome:** Gained practical understanding of DOM performance considerations and modular code design

> Each project is intentionally designed to teach and help me demonstrate system thinking, constraint management, applied learning and iterative improvement, rather than just to follow instructions.

## 🧠 Approach to Learning

1. Analyze the problem deeply before coding  
2. Plan and structure the system, separating concerns and defining boundaries  
3. Iterate deliberately, testing, refactoring, and documenting decisions  
4. Reflect on trade-offs, performance, and maintainability  
5. Track all progress in Git, showing clear evolution of the system

## 🚀 Trajectory

Currently focusing on:

- Building complex JavaScript systems with API integration  
- Exploring backend fundamentals with CRUD operations and data modeling  
- Developing system design thinking by planning and building small completely funtional full-stack mini-systems  
- Strengthening problem-solving, debugging, and performance optimization skills

My goal is to grow into an engineer who can take ownership of systems from conception to deployment.

## 🤝 Collaboration

Open to contributing to:

- Real-world full-stack systems  
- Learning-focused or open-source projects with clear impact  
- Projects that require deliberate design, testing, and iteration

## ⚡ Human Note

I practice *rubber duck debugging*. Surprisingly, the ducks are excellent listeners.
