I am an emerging software engineer building **web systems end-to-end** to understand how software behaves in real conditions.  
I focus on **solving tangible problems, making design decisions under constraints, and iterating deliberately**.

## 🛠️ Applied Skills

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, DOM manipulation  
- **Backend (learning):** Node.js, REST APIs  
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub workflow with commit discipline  
- **System Design & Problem Solving:** decomposing problems, balancing constraints, and reflecting on trade-offs

Skills are demonstrated through **projects I structure as systems**, not tutorials.

## 🔹 Projects

### 1. Calculator System
- **Problem:** Build a calculator handling all basic arithmetic reliably  
- **Constraints:** Correctly handle edge cases, maintain separation of logic for calculations and display  
- **Decisions:** Modularized JS functions; event-driven interaction; error handling for invalid inputs  
- **Outcome:** Learned how to manage state cleanly and enforce predictable behavior in interactive applications

### 2. Browser-Based Game
- **Problem:** Implement a Rock-Paper-Scissors game with randomized computer opponent  
- **Constraints:** Responsive UI, accurate game logic, user input validation  
- **Decisions:** Event delegation, DOM updates optimized for clarity, modular code for maintainability  
- **Outcome:** Practiced handling asynchronous interactions and iterative feedback loops

### 3. Interactive Grid Drawing System
- **Problem:** Create a dynamic grid allowing drawing and resizing  
- **Constraints:** Performance optimization, dynamic DOM handling, reset functionality  
- **Decisions:** Dynamic grid creation, event delegation for efficient performance  
- **Outcome:** Gained practical understanding of DOM performance considerations and modular code design

> Each project is intentionally designed to **teach me system thinking, constraint management, and iterative improvement**, rather than just to follow instructions.

## 🧠 Approach to Learning

1. **Analyze the problem deeply** before coding  
2. **Plan and structure the system**, separating concerns and defining boundaries  
3. **Iterate deliberately**, testing, refactoring, and documenting decisions  
4. **Reflect on trade-offs**, performance, and maintainability  
5. **Track all progress in Git**, showing clear evolution of the system

This ensures **evidence of thought, discipline, and applied learning**.

## 🚀 Trajectory

Currently focusing on:

- Building **complex JavaScript systems** with API integration  
- Exploring **backend fundamentals** with CRUD operations and data modeling  
- Developing **system design thinking** by planning and building small full-stack mini-systems  
- Strengthening **problem-solving, debugging, and performance optimization skills**

My goal is to grow into an engineer who can **take ownership of systems from conception to deployment**.

## ⚡ Human Note

I practice *rubber duck debugging*. Surprisingly, the ducks are excellent listeners.
