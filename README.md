# Software Engineering Student (Early Career)

[![Typing SVG](https://readme-typing-svg.demolab.com?font=Fira+Code&pause=900&width=560&lines=Learning+by+Building+and+Explaining;System-Oriented+Problem+Solving;Depth+Before+Scale;Evidence+Over+Claims.)](https://git.io/typing-svg)

I am early in my development and deliberate about staying that way.  
I focus on building small, complete systems I can fully understand, document, and explain.

My goal is not speed or surface-level complexity, but engineering depth:  
understanding how software behaves under real constraints, how decisions affect maintainability, and how systems evolve through iteration.

## 🧠 Engineering Mindset

- I treat projects as systems, not demos  
- I separate concerns before writing code  
- I make trade-offs explicit and document decisions  
- I value clarity, correctness, and predictability over cleverness  
- I use Git to show *how* my thinking evolves, not just final results

## 🛠️ Applied Skills (Current)

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (DOM manipulation, event-driven logic)
- **Backend (learning):** Node.js, REST APIs
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub (disciplined commits, incremental progress)
- **Problem Solving:** decomposition, constraint analysis, trade-off evaluation

Skills are demonstrated through projects structured as systems, not tutorials.

## 📈 Current Focus

- Building more complex JavaScript systems with API integration - "**Stashu - Under construction**"
- Learning backend fundamentals through CRUD operations and data modeling
- Designing and completing small, fully functional full-stack systems
- Improving debugging, performance reasoning, and documentation discipline

My aim is to grow into an engineer who can take ownership of systems from problem definition to deployment.

## 🤝 Collaboration

Open to:
- Learning-focused open-source projects
- Small, real-world systems with clear constraints
- Work that values documentation, testing, and iteration

## ⚡ Human Note

I practice rubber-duck debugging.  
The ducks are excellent listeners and they never interrupt - which is rare.
